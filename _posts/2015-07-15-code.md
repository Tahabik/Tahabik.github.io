I'm gonna show you a sample code in rust which is a growing coding language.
This simple code get an input from the user and then calculates the square of the number

````markdown
```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // Prompt the user for input
    println!("Enter a number:");

    // Create a mutable string to store the user input
    let mut input = String::new();

    // Read the user input
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");

    // Parse the input as a floating-point number
    let number: f64 = match input.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => {
            println!("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.");
            return;
        }
    };

    // Calculate the square of the number
    let square = number * number;

    // Display the result
    println!("The square of {} is: {}", number, square);
}
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598).
This is just a dummy example of me playing with code post in al-folio and because of that i want to place a code from ruby in the part below.
it is not for an specific purpose.
there is something fun in writing code here that you can write before and after the code in the markdown area

````markdown
exp : this is fun .

   now iam going to put a code in c in the part below:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(){
        printf("hi");
    }
    ```

   2. just prints "hi" 
````

so this was a tour of the code posts of the al-folio it was not fun at all.
