this type of post is a template to write math equations in a systematic way and uses the [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.



$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum*{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum*{k=1}^n a*k^2 \right) \left( \sum*{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
